## About the report
* Takeaways
    * Male gamers and those in the 20-24 age group make up a higher percentage of game players, so overall they bring more revenue to the game.
    * However, female gamers and people in the 35-39 age range spend more on average, meaning that if you can find a way to increase the number of those players, you might be able to increase profits more efficiently.
    * Oathbreaker, Fiery Glass Crusader and Nirvana are among both the most popular and the most profitable items, making them good candidates for further marketing & promotion.
